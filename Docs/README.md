# 🧠 GrowthVault

**A living study repo documenting my path to becoming a Polyglot Software Engineer.**

This repository is where I learn, write, and test across multiple programming languages — building a strong foundation in both software development and problem-solving.  
Every folder here represents progress, practice, and curiosity — from syntax drills to mini-projects that connect theory to real-world application.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To master **multiple programming languages and frameworks** while building a deep understanding of software engineering concepts across stacks.  
The mission is to become a **polyglot developer** — fluent in many languages, adaptable in any environment, and capable of bridging systems together.

> “Code fluently, think in systems, and build without boundaries.”

## 💻 Languages & Frameworks I’m Studying

### 🐍 **Python**
- Syntax, data structures, and algorithms  
- OOP fundamentals and file handling  
- Building simple automation scripts and CLI tools  

### ⚡ **JavaScript / TypeScript**
- Core JS concepts: arrays, loops, events, and ES6+ syntax  
- DOM manipulation and asynchronous programming  
- API calls and data handling  
- Transitioning into TypeScript for scalable projects  

### ⚛️ **React**
- Component-based architecture  
- State and props fundamentals  
- Building UI elements, layouts, and reactivity  
- Later: connecting to APIs and building a full portfolio project  

### 🎨 **Tailwind CSS / HTML / CSS**
- Modern responsive design fundamentals  
- Clean UI construction using Tailwind utility classes  
- Focus on consistent themes and accessibility  

### ⚙️ **Node.js**
- Backend fundamentals, HTTP requests, and REST APIs  
- File system and server handling with Express  
- Modular programming and data management  

### 🧩 **C++ / C#**
- Learning memory management and compiled language structure  
- Understanding data types, loops, pointers, and classes  
- Applying these skills to algorithm practice and system-level logic  

### ☕ **Java**
- Object-oriented design  
- Exception handling, collections, and standard libraries  
- Prepping for Android and backend work later  

### 🦀 **Rust** *(planned)*
- Exploring ownership, lifetimes, and memory safety  
- Understanding performance-driven backend programming  

### 🐹 **Go (Golang)**
- Building high-performance backend systems  
- Exploring concurrency with goroutines and channels  
- Practicing lightweight APIs and microservices  
- Understanding deployment simplicity and scalability  

### 🧮 **SQL**
- Learning relational database fundamentals  
- Writing queries, joins, and CRUD operations  
- Understanding normalization, indexes, and optimization  
- Integrating SQL with backend systems for full-stack workflows

## 🧱 Areas of Study

- Algorithms & Data Structures  
- Design Patterns  
- Version Control & Git Workflows  
- API Design & Integration  
- Frontend & Backend Architecture  
- Databases & SQL Queries  
- Deployment & CI/CD Basics  

Each topic is documented through notes, examples, or code exercises under the relevant folders.

---

## 🚀 Projects & Practice

This repo also includes smaller, focused projects under **Code-Write** — built to reinforce what I study:

- 🧮 **Algorithm Practice:** small logic problems and pattern challenges  
- 🌐 **Mini Web Projects:** portfolio pages, blogs, and dashboards  
- ⚙️ **CLI Scripts:** automation and data-handling experiments  
- 🧠 **Language Demos:** syntax comparisons between languages  

---

## 📘 Notes & Logs

I maintain structured notes under `/Notes` for consistency:
- **roadmap.md** → my current learning plan and milestones  
- **daily-log.md** → what I’ve learned each day  
- **resources.md** → helpful links, tutorials, and documentation  
- **progress.md** → tracking overall skill growth  

---

## 🧭 Long-Term Vision

To build a personal **polyglot ecosystem** —  
where I can design systems using multiple languages together, such as:
- Python for data logic  
- Go or Rust for backend performance  
- SQL for data management  
- JavaScript/React for frontend  
- Node.js APIs connecting everything  

Ultimately, this repo is the foundation for that journey — documenting every step, line of code, and improvement made along the way.
